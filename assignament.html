	The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
	It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly 
	referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the 
	wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can 
	also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids 
	human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship 
	and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by 
	various cat registries.

				You may love your cat, but you may not be fully aware of just 
				how cool your she — and her overall species — really is. For 
				example, did you know that cats have an extra organ that allows 
				them to taste scents? Or that they developed meowing as a way 
				to communicate exclusively with humans?
				
				Clearly, there’s more to your little feline friend than meets 
				the eye. So, to help you fully appreciate how awesome cats are, 
				we asked cat care professionals on Care.com — namely, cat sitters, 
				boarders, and groomers — to share their favorite fun facts about 
				these mystical creatures. We then pulled together a list of the 
				101 most amusing cat facts that you can share with your friends 
				and family.

		<p>
			A dog is a mammal in the order Carnivora. The history of dogs is an 
			old tale indeed. You could say as long as there has been civilisation,
			there have been records of humans and dogs. Dogs were domesticated 
			from wolves around 15,000 years ago. New evidence suggests that dogs 
			were first domesticated in East Asia, possibly China. Over time, the 
			dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great degree of 
			variation.

			Highly Social Animals
			Dogs, like humans, are highly social animals and this similarity in their overall behavioural pattern accounts for their trainability, playfulnes and ability to fit into human households and social situations. This similarity has earned dogs a unique position in the realm of interspecies relationships.
