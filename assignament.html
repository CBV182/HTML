	The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
	It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly 
	referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the 
	wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can 
	also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids 
	human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship 
	and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by 
	various cat registries.

			European wildcat.[59] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body 
			length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long 
			tails. Males are larger than females.[60] Adult domestic cats typically 
			weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).[43]
