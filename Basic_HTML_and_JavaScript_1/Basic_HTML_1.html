    	<font color="red" face "verdana" size="6">O my Luve's like a red, red rose,
            That's newly sprung in June:
            O my Luve's like the melodie,
            That's sweetly play'd in tune.
            
            As fair art thou, my bonie lass,
            So deep in luve am I;
            And I will luve thee still, my dear,
            Till a' the seas gang dry.
            
            Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
            And the rocks melt wi' the sun;
            And I will luve thee still, my dear,
            While the sands o' life shall run.
            
            And fare-thee-weel, my only Luve!
            And fare-thee-weel, a while!
            And I will come again, my Luve,
            Tho' 'twere ten thousand mile!</font>
