    <p class="one">Coral snake, any of more than 100 species of small, 
        secretive, and brightly patterned venomous snakes of 
        the cobra family (Elapidae). New World coral snakes 
        range in size from 40 to 160 cm (16 to 63 inches) and 
        are classified in two genera (Micruroides and Micrurus); 
        they are found mainly in the tropics. 
        Three additional 
        genera of related snakes live in Asia and Africa. Most 
        species are tricoloured (rarely bicoloured), with 
        various combinations of red, black, and yellow or white 
        rings; width of the rings varies. All have smooth scales 
        and a short tail. Short hollow fangs deliver a potent 
        neurotoxic venom. Micrurus has the most species of the 
        New World coral snake genera, about 80. 
        They range from the southern United States to Argentina. 
        Only two species, however, live in the United States. 
        The eastern coral snake, or harlequin snake 
        (Micrurus fulvius), which lives in the southeastern U.S., 
        is about 1 metre (3.3 feet) long and has wide red and black 
        rings separated by narrow rings of yellow. The Arizona coral 
        snake (Micruroides euryxanthus) is a small (40–50-cm) 
        inhabitant of the American Southwest. In most classifications, 
        Old World coral snakes comprise the genera Calliophis (with 10 species) 
        and Sinomicrurus (five species) of southern Asia and the genus 
        Hemibungarus (three species) of the Philippines. Some classifications 
        also include African harlequin snakes (Homoroselaps), which are known 
        for their pronounced orange, black, and yellow coloration. Although some
        classifications of New World coral snakes also include the genus 
        Leptomicrurus (two species), most place members of this group into 
        the genus Micrurus. There are 50 genera of coral snake mimics, 
        such as the false coral snakes (see king snake and scarlet snake), 
        and nearly one-third of all American species have some coral snake pattern. 
        The rhymes “Red on yellow, kill a fellow, red on black, venom lack” and 
        “Red and yellow can kill a fellow; Red and black, friend of Jack” are 
        two of several similar mnemonics that have been used to distinguish 
        coral snakes from similar North American snakes, such as the scarlet 
        king snake (Lampropeltis elapsoides). Herpetologists note that these 
        rhymes are useful in separating true coral snakes from their mimics 
        in the United States, but people should not rely upon them in other 
        parts of the world.
        Coral snakes belong to the family Elapidae, which also includes cobras 
        and various other venomous snakes. Most coral snakes prey on other snakes,
        particularly worm snakes and blind snakes, lizards being a secondary 
        food source. New World coral snakes lay 1 to 13 eggs. The longevity record 
        for Micrurus in captivity is 18 years.

        The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources 
        (IUCN) considers most coral snakes to be species of least concern. However, 
        it lists the Catamayo coral snake (Micrurus catamayensis) of Ecuador and 
        the Merida coral snake (M. meridensis) of western Venezuela as endangered 
        species and the Roatan coral snake (M. ruatanus) of Roatán island in Honduras 
        and coral snakes from the species M. medemi of central Colombia as critically 
        endangered species.</p>
