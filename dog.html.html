                The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris
                [5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called 
                the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, 
                and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
                 Dogs were the first species to be domesticated.

	 "In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species 
     Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris and therefore did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species."
